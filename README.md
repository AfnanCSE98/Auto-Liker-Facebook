# Auto-Liker-Facebook
You want to irritate someone by giving likes to his facebook posts and flood him/her with notifications?This is where I have automated the task.
First, you need to install `pyautogui` and `opencv-python`.
```
pip install pyautogui
python -m pip install opencv_python
```
Then copy your friend's profile url and paste it in the line 5 of autolike.py.You can change the number of posts you want to like too.Now run the python script.
